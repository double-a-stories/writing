## Outline ##

### Prologue ####

* Fennel (they/them) is a meek white mouse. After a stressful week at work Cain (he/him), has invited them to safely indulge their mutual vore fetish at an AirBNB up in the mountains. Fennel is nervous, but Cain lovingly "guides" them into accepting. Cain and his friend hired a vore performer named Syx, a friendly and charming tigress, for a hot vore orgy.
* Lots of subtle/unsubtle red flags of the abusive/manipulative way Cain operates (setting fast deadlines, asking for decisions when Fennel is tired and grumpy, love-bombing). Also show a contrast in the way Cain and Winny casually ignore consent, while Ilex, Val, and Syx do their best to practice it.

### Act 1 ####
* Friday evening.
* Fennel and Cain arrive after a 4 hour uber ride, and meet Winny, a narcissistic black rabbit, and her polycule of (also-extremely-recent) girlfriends Ilex, a meek puppygirl, and Val, horny ass rabbit.  No red flags here. We spend a brief time getting to know them, and the cabin, which has 3 bedrooms, a hot tub, and a spacious living room. For fuuckin'.
* Winnie notices a small dirty spot in the kitchen, and steps out (very little cell reception) to furiously call the cabin's owner and demand a more thorough job next time [[cares a *lot* about cleaning up spills, hmm.]]. True Karen behavior. Val is really horny and propositions Fennel for sex, then asks Ilex to "help her out with her uh... luggage" [[penis]]. The two of them disappear into their bedroom, leaving Fennel and Cain.
* Cain is consistently pretty dismissive of Fennel's emotional state, but likes kissing and teasing them. He goes off to unpack his stuff [[secretive about his baggage?]], and tells Fennel to get started on dinner, leaving them along with their thoughts.
* Light conversation over dinner. Winny and Cain catch up about work (they're old richkid college buddies). Val keeps pawing at Fennel's paws and crotch under the table. They pretend not to notice, but after working her way up their thighs and jabbing at their crotch, they blush furiously and choke on their food. Val realizes that they were touching them and not Ilex like she meant to, and laughs.
* After dinner, Ilex and Val privately talk to Fennel and they both apologize for Val's presumptuous behavior or crossing any boundaries. Fennel emphasizes that they're not bothered, and are okay with being involved in stuff. After all, they're gonna be stuffed into a gut together, right? So might as well get comfy. Val (consensually) hugs Fennel happily and Ilex smiles and blushes, unable to stop her tail from wagging. She asks Val to "help her out" and they disappear again.
* That evening, Cain teases and fucks the shit out of Fennel's ass, all the while roleplaying as a strong, powerful pred "Gonna grind you into shiiiit, little mouse". Seemingly more for his pleasure than theirs. Fennel really doesn't like the digestion talk, even in fantasy, so just lies there, bottoming, until Cain is spent, and collapses.

### Act 2 ###
* You spend the morning reading in the kitchen, enjoying a soothing tea.
* The girls are down in the hot tub. Cain is off on a morning jog (cardio!). Fennel is alone in the kitchen.
* 3PM: ding dong. enter: Syx. She's... much bigger than Fennel imagined. "If I'm not mistaken, there's supposed to be more of you?"
* The bunnies enter the living room and eagerly greet the pred. They're very friendly with Syx, and she allows them to rub and touch her gut and mouth as they please, which elicits satisfied noises from her. Cain and Winnie return, and greet Syx, but are much more terse with her, viewing her more as an object. Syx explains to Winnie that she was just making you more comfortable. Winny (acknowleding Fennel for seemingly the first time) insists on a little foreplay to make they understand it's perfectly safe.
* "Syx, eat Val," she commands, which elicits a disgruntled reaction from the tiger, but Val is perfectly okay with it. She conspicuously swallows a pink tablet. [[Winny eyes her thoughtfully as she does.]] Fennel watches in awe as she strips the eager Val naked, and effortlessly slurps her down into a chatty wriggling bellybulge, explaining the whole process. Syx asks Fennel if they'd like to have their face burped in, and they eagerly nod, then get absolutely blasted with intoxicating dogbreath.  "Fuuuuck," Cain groans, clearly aroused at the sight, "that never gets old." He reaches behind you and startles you by pulling off your shirt. Wtf? "Heh, you won't be needing clothes where you're going." Fennel hesitates and says they'd prefer to watch for now, which Cain accepts still insists on partially undressing them and groping their (bound) chest and belly. "Kitty want another treat, huh?" he teases, and Winny gets Ilex swallowed up too, fitting easily as well. Syx glares slightly at his remark, but ignores it, pampering and praising the girls, rubbing their bulge, making her squirm. Winny watches approvingly, and darkly teases the bunnies about how little prey sluts should know their place, and she shoots you a glance too. Ilex flushes and Val wriggles with delight.
* "Alright, let 'em out. We've got all night to enjoy Ms. Syx's company, after all." On command, Syx bends down, and guides Ilex and then Val back up her esophagus, and onto a waiting towel to dry off. Winny beckons the horny Ilex over on all fours, pets her like a puppy, and commands her to jerk off to completion. Very dommy mommy. Cain takes the opportunity to masturbate as well. You check on Syx, and help Val to her feet. Val is dizzy and damp, but utterly in love. She asks to kiss and hump you, and, to your surprise, the three of you collapse into a messy horny pile next to Syx's gut. Syx grins, and "assists" by letting out another fat belch, licking and nibbling. You don't cum, but it's altogether, a pretty good time.
* The lot of you have lunch. Syx just has a few (giant-size) mimosas [[spiked drinks?]]. Some chill time. TV and board game type stuff. Cain watches The Game.
* Fennel ends up alone on the porch, overlooking the mountains, struck with horrible foreboding. Syx joins them.
* They open up about feeling extremely awkward and nervous about their first time doing this, but she helps make them more comfortable. She lounges on the floor while they sit on a chair, equalizing their levels. They chat about vore, sex work, Fennel's kinks, and boundaries. Fennel is sort of oblivious to how this all works, and Syx helpfully explains that digestion is 100% off-limits. She shows them her personal supply of anti-digestion tablets, which will keep her prey safe all night. And she's a light sleeper, so any kind of motion should wake her up. She soothes their nerves further by negotiating a safe rhythm with them, which Fennel can tap or kick and be regurgitated. Shave and a furcut, two bits! She demonstrates by having them tap on the outside of her rumbly gut, which flusters them, and makes her giggle. Fennel offers her a snack, but she reminds them that she has to keep her stomach empty; unless they *want* to sit around amongst a bunch of mashed up food, which really isn't as pleasant as it sounds.
* "I'll see you after dinner, okay?" she says, and winks.

### Act 2b ###
* Time for the big event. Time to get swallowed. Some foreplay, etc. etc. Cain insists on stripping Fennel naked, revealing their tits, which their hate. But quickly they're distracted by Syx, who's giving them full-on mouthy foreplay (voreplay?) while Ilex and Val "amuse" each other.
* Syx smokes a little weed, takes a big handful of tablets, then guides Fennel as she swallows them down. It's everything Fennel could ever hope, and they have a moment to really enjoy it. She asks if you're ready for company, Val, Ilex, and Fennel are all squashed together in Syx's gut, to spend all night in there. Syx yawns and burps happily, rubbing her fat gut.
* The three of you have amazing gay vore sex, trapped as you are. Cain and Winnie both enjoy your motions from outside, teasing and poking. Cum hard.
* But soon, you start to feel digestive acids prickle at your skin. Wtf?? Shave and a hair cut! Shave and a hair cut! Syx responds by... snoring? She's out like a light. You fight and kick to no avail (we've established that Syx has to consciously let you out). You cry out to Cain and Winny to wake her up, who both laugh maniacally at your predicament. You're... gonna die in here?

### Act 3 ###
* Cain confesses that this was the plan all along, from the very start of your short-lived relationship. He and Winny are serial killers, who love watching prey die inside of guts. You're the third set of victim he's done this to. Winny chimes in, this is the first time they've been able to do 3 at a time. They're *really* pleased with themselves. They explain that Cain switched her anti-digestion tablets with similar-looking pills to keep her under, while they spend all night watching the three of you slowly digest into gut-mulch; poor Syx will awaken tomorrow to a big sloshy gut, and an empty house. Meanwhile, they masturbate and tease you about dying as you squirm and struggle.
* Miraculously [[deus ex machina]], Syx wakes up, and (noticing your cry for help) barfs you out. Hm, guess they must have gotten the dose wrong for a tiger her size. C&W don't seem too perturbed by this, though. Actually, it just means more fun. Plan B. Syx comes to, complains that her head feels funny. Her mouth is watering, her eyes are shot... She lets out in an involuntary growl. Oh no... G-get away. Winny must have laced her weed with [[PLAUSIBLE SOUNDING DRUG]]. Basically really strong catnip. Or the blue stuff from Zootopia. She becomes pretty much feral, and extremely hungry. You smell like food.
* Chase time. Ilex and Val panic and try to run, but Val's paws slips on the hardwood (you're all covered in tummygoop, member?). Winny grabs Val and holds her out to the beastly Syx, who sniffs her and opens wide to eat her again. Fennel (finally actually displaying some protagonist energy) body slam Winny and knock her off balance. The three of you escape down back into the girls' bedroom and close yourselves in. Ilex (largest of you three) holds the door shut, while Val struggles to get a window open, and you try (fruitlessly) to call the cops (Val: "yeah, that's what this place needs, more sadistic monsters"). You and Ilex push a bed in front of the door, and Val opens the window to reveal... Syx, climbing in through it! Jumpscare.
* She pins you to the floor, growling and tasting you as you whimper in fear. Playing with her food. Val and Ilex muscle to unblock the door. You catch a glimpse of C&W watching eagerly from outside. You feebly try to push back against her with your paws and the monster ravenously licks and tastes your face with her massive tongue, before opening wide to devour you, possibly not even in one piece this time. Your weakening struggles devolve into soft pats. Shave and a hair cut! Shave and a hair cut!
* She stops, and blinks. Miraculously [[deus ex machina]] this works to calm her down for just a moment. "Wh-what... Where am I... Fennel?" she asks. "S-Syx!" Ilex cries, "Stop! Cain and Winny, they switched your meds and drugged you!" "They..." she stares drowsily at her paws, then turns to look out the window. "What?" "T-tried to make you digest us," Fennel whimpers, still cowering. Still bestial and clambering on all fours, Syx glares at C&W, who are now slowly retreating. She growls furiously: "They... tried to... hurt you. Tried to make me... hurt you? grrrrrrrrrr-AAH!!!!" C&W both break into a sprint drown the gravel driveway.
* The enormous tigress soars back through the open window. You helplessly watch her rampage. She picks up Cain, and throws him hard into a tree. He coughs up some blood. She grabs Winny and stuffs her down her throat, ravenously gulping and choking on her, before doing the same to Cain, depositing them both into her belly, before stalking back inside. How the turn tables.
* She seems to gradually calm down after that, and regain some of her senses. "O-oh gods, Fennel. Lex. Val. I'm... so sorry." She gestures to her screaming, squirming, gut, "I think I can still cough them up... uhm, if you want." Ilex shakes her head and says firmly, "No, let them suffer." Fennel is mortified, but Val cheers her on. The four of them sit solemly together all night as their abusers gurgle away in her gut.
* Sunday morning.
* Wake up to the midday sun, lying against Syx's big soft gut. Horrible sickly feeling, but glad to be alive. Syx excuses herself to take a massive shit.
* You all clean everything up (including the toilet, eugh), and get your stories straight. Cops hopefully shouldn't be an issue, since C&V paid for everything anonymously. There's no record they were even here; since they were planning to kill you, they already did all the cover-ups necessary.
* Val and Ilex comfort you, and you all get a Lyft (XL) home. Maybe you're dating these trauma-bonded lesbians now? Syx, shaken, goes her separate way and decides not to take any jobs for a while. You apologize profusely.

The End.

## Other notes

* Long story, huh? Better not fuck up the pacing.
* Let's punch up the prologue. I think it could be a chatlog, but it needs clearer.
* Having so many characters risks some of them becoming superfluous. Cain and Winnie kinda blur together in the finale, so make sure they keep their individual flair.
* Second person is very tempting, and helps justify why Fennel has so little agency. Maybe this should be another adventure game?
* Or let's just give Fennel more agency?
* Ilex's name is a holdover from when she was a bunny. should probably give her a name less similar to Syx.
